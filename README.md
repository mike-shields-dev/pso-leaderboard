# Penalty Shootout Leaderboard

This is the National Football Museum's Penalty Shootout Leaderboard Application.

The application has been created to improve the way that visitor's scores/results from using the Penalty Shootout Interactive Exhibit are presented. 

The current leaderboard consists of an magnetic whiteboard/easel that the Museum Assistants manually update throughout the day, using whiteboard markers and writeable magnetic strips (think Top Gear).

The request was made to see if something more visually appealing could be created using Web Technologies. 

There were certain requirements that the application needed to meet: 

- Run on a single computer. 
- Not depend on an external server.
- Not be connected to the LAN (unless remote shutdown is required)
- Have a small screen with keyboard and mouse, for the UI, where staff can enter each players score.
- Have a larger screen for the display of the Leaderboard. 
- Use hardware/equipment that the museum already has. 
- Automatically start-up when the computer boots, with each screen displaying content in kiosk mode.
- Allow staff to enter a players first name(s), last initial, points scored & fastest ball speed.  
- List player scores in order of points scored, or if multiple scores are the same, then in order of fastest ball speed. 
- Allow staff to revert/undo the last entry to the leaderboard incase of typos or other mistakes. 
- Display the content in a visually appealing way, that will hopefully improve the visitor experience and entice more visitors to play the game.
